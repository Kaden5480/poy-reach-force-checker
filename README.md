## Custom game locations
If you installed Peaks of Yore in a custom game location, you may require
an extra file to configure the build so it knows where to find the Peaks of Yore game
libraries.

The file must be in the root of this repository and must be called "GamePath.props".

Below gives an example where Peaks of Yore is installed on the F drive:
```xml
<Project>
  <PropertyGroup>
    <GamePath>F:\Games\Peaks of Yore</GamePath>
  </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```
